## Project elaboration
### Abstract
### Motivation for the project
Acquiring new customers is typically far more cost intensive than retaining existing customers. Especially for fast growing businesses with a strong focus on acquiring new customers it is crutial to put equal effort into retaining the existing customers ([Forbes][1]).
To prevent customers to turn their back to your company, the first critical step is to identify customers who have the potential to churn. Having identified potential churn customers one can take action to retain the customers. 

Today's online businesses have a vast data pool to use to predict churn. To be able to predict churn one needs adequate knowledge about adequate machine learning models in order to make the prediction as well as adequate knowledge about big data tools to handle the tremendous amount of data in these businesses. 

In my capstone project I therefore want to use a big data dataset to predict churn. I am using the Sparkify-dataset, a dataset of a hypothetical music streaming service such as Spotify, to early-detect churn.
